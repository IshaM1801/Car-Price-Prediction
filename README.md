# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸš—ðŸ“Š  

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the selling price of used cars based on various factors like the carâ€™s age, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission type. The dataset is processed, analyzed, and modeled using **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression**, achieving high accuracy.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature selection.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset with visualizations and statistics.  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - **Linear Regression**: Establishes a relationship between car attributes and price.  
  - **Lasso Regression**: Applies regularization to reduce overfitting.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses R-squared error and visualization to assess accuracy.  
- **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots to compare actual vs. predicted prices.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  
- `car data.csv`: Dataset containing car details and selling prices.  
- `car_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- **Linear Regression RÂ² Score**: ~0.88 (Training), ~0.83 (Testing)  
- **Lasso Regression RÂ² Score**: ~0.84 (Training), ~0.83 (Testing)  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the models.  

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements  
- Implement additional regression models (e.g., Ridge, Decision Tree).  
- Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.  
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
